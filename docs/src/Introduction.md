# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for **rustecal** â€“ safe Rust bindings for [Eclipse eCAL](https://github.com/eclipse-ecal/ecal). 

**rustecal** provides a safe and idiomatic Rust interface over the eCAL C API, enabling high-performance interprocess communication (IPC) in areas such as robotics, automotive, and embedded systems.

This documentation covers:

- An overview of the project structure and architecture.
- Detailed API documentation for core components such as publishers and subscribers.
- Examples and guides for using both the untyped (raw) and typed pub/sub APIs.
- Integration details for external type support (for example, for strings, bytes, and Protobuf messages).
